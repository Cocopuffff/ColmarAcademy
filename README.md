What did you like about this project?

Models real world requirements! Very challenging.

What did you struggle with in this project?

I spent too much time unifying common styles which caused me to be rush for time towards the end & my RWD was not perfect.
RWD was an after thought when creating classes which caused issues when coding RWD css.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?

I need more time! I am unhappy that my RWD was totally in spec. I am also not happy that my CSS code is all over the place! I could have spent another 3 hours just tidying up my work.
